This is an Angular web app to create a simple symmetrical triangular graph. The user enters three values, namely start time (which is 0 in the example graph below), 
end time (which is 0.01 in the example graph below) and maximum value (which is 50 in the graph below) and then a 
button to confirm the values.

Update-
User input is taken for two values, namely period and amplitude and then a sinusoidal(sine) graph is created.
